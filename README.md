## About the Book
Qt 5, the latest version of Qt, enables you to develop applications with complex user interfaces for multiple targets. It provides you with faster and smarter ways to create modern UIs and applications for multiple platforms. This book will teach you to design and build graphical user interfaces that are functional, appealing, and user-friendly.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All code files have been placed in their respective folder.

The code will look like the following:
```
void MainWindow::test()
{
  int amount = 100;
  amount -= 10;
  qDebug() << "You have obtained" << amount << "apples!";
}
```

In order to successfully execute all the codes and instructions in this book, you would need:
* A basic PC/Laptop
* A working internet connection
* Qt 5.10
* MariaDB 10.2 (or MySQL Connector)
* Filezilla Server 0.9

We will deal with the installation processes and details as we go through each chapter.
